# How It Works
Simple Microsite Builder offers an easy solution for anyone who wants to build a tiny website without much time and effort.

Just fill in the form with your own words and we will publish it to the web for you. If you have an image file you want to use, upload it in any public server you like and put the reference URL in the box. You can also embed Google Map, Youtube video, Twitter feed and other code snippets from third-parties.

You can update your microsite after publishing by accessing the Editor URL provided at the time of site creation. All the information you entered in the form is stored in a Jig. Your microsite's design template is also tied to a Jig.
